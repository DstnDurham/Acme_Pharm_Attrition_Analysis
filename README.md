# HR Employee Attrition Analysis
## Project Overview
This project aims to explore and understand the key factors contributing to employee attrition within an organization. By analyzing patterns in demographic, job-related, and satisfaction data, we seek to uncover actionable insights that can help improve employee retention strategies and overall workplace satisfaction.

### Objectives

* Diagnose attrition drivers: Identify which personal, professional, and environmental factors most strongly correlate with employees leaving the company.
* Determine which employee segments (e.g., departments, job roles, tenure groups) are at higher risk of attrition.
* Create interactive dashboards to highlight patterns in satisfaction, compensation, and work-life balance that may contribute to turnover
* Develop data-driven recommendations to improve employee retention and engagement.
